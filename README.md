# Real Estate Dashboard


## About this project:
"Our Power BI dashboard for the real estate company offers an in-depth analysis of properties, categorizing them based on renovation status, waterfront accessibility, bedroom count, floors, condition, and location. By amalgamating diverse datasets encompassing property listings, historical sales data, market trends, renovation logs, and geographic information, the dashboard delivers a comprehensive overview. It enables stakeholders to swiftly identify renovated versus non-renovated properties, assess waterfront availability, ascertain bedroom and floor specifications, evaluate property conditions, and understand location-based trends. This detailed insight equips decision-makers with the necessary information to strategize effectively, optimize investments, and capitalize on opportunities in the dynamic real estate market."
